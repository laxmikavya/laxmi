   <h1>POEM1</h1>
   <h2>THE ROSE FAMILY</h2>
   <pre><p>
       The rose is a rose,
       And was always a rose.
       But the theory now goes
       That the apple`s a rose, 
       And the pear is, and so`s
       The  plum, I suppoose .
       The dear only knows
       What will next prove a rose. 
       You, ofcourse, are arose- 
       But were always a rose.

Curtains forcing their will
against the wind,          
children sleep,
exchanging dreams with
seraphim.The city
drags  it self awake on 
subway traps;and
I an alarm , awake as a
rumor of war 
lie stretching into down 
unasked and un heeded
